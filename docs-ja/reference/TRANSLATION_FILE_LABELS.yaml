# Translation File Labels Configuration

# This file allows marking files with special labels to indicate:
# - Files with intentional English content (quotes, technical documentation)
# - Files that are difficult for AI to translate (requires human review)
# - Files that are considered resolved despite having English content
#
# Labels:
#   - intentional_english: File contains English content that should remain (e.g., quotes, code examples)
#   - ai_difficult: File is difficult for AI to translate automatically (requires human expertise)
#   - resolved: File is considered resolved despite having some English content
#   - needs_human_review: File needs human review before marking as complete
