"*FIRST*\\ :sup:`®` programs, such as *FIRST*\\ :sup:`®` LEGO\\ :sup:`®` "
"League, *FIRST*\\ :sup:`®` Tech Challenge, and *FIRST*\\ :sup:`®` "
"Robotics Competition, are as unique as the teams that participate in "
"them. This uniqueness is partially due to the wide variety of vendors "
"that provide technologies to the programs, the hardware and software "
"necessary to manage each program’s distinctive goals, and the constantly "
"evolving landscape of tools and techniques that teams find useful to "
"participate and excel. One commonality between programs is the need for "
"teams to have a computer platform for software development, design, and "
"collaboration. This document serves as a recommendation for the hardware "
"and operating system requirements for that computer system."
