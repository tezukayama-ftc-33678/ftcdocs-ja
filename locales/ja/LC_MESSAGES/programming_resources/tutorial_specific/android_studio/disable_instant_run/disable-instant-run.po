"If you are an Android Studio user, one of **the most important steps to "
"take** is to disable Android Studio Instant Run. Instant Run is a feature"
" that is designed to streamline the development process by reducing the "
"time to apply code changes to your app. Unfortunately, Instant Run is "
"limited in function and when used with the *FIRST* Tech Challenge Android"
" Studio project folder, can cause **severe** and **difficult-to-"
"troubleshoot** problems."
