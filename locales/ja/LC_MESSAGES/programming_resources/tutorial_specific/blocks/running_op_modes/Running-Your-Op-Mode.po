"If your OpMode requires input from a gamepad, then you will need to "
"connect a Logitech F310 or other approved gamepad to the DRIVER STATION. "
"Note that you can have up to two gamepads connected to a DRIVER STATION. "
"If using a phone, this will require a USB hub. However, in this example, "
"we will only have a solitary gamepad connected."
