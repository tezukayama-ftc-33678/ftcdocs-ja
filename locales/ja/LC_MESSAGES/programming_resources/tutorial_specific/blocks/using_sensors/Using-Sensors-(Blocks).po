"The Color-Range sensor uses reflected light to determine the distance "
"from the sensor to the target object. It can be used to measure close "
"distances (up 5\" or more) with reasonable accuracy. Note that at the "
"time this document was most recently edited, the REV Color-Range sensor "
"saturates around 2\" (5cm). This means that for distances less than or "
"equal to 2\", the sensor returns a measured distance equal to 2\" or so."
