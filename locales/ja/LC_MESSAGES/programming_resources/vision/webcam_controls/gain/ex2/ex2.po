"Higher gain does improve recognition, then performance declines. Then at "
"higher levels, this TFOD model begins to “see” a Cube, not a Duck. The "
"gain effect was similar to the exposure effect."

msgid ""
"These two charts suggest that TFOD results are affected by, and can "
"perhaps be optimized by, setting specific values for exposure and gain. A"
" team should compare this with the default or automatic performance of "
"their robot and webcam, in the full range of expected match conditions."
