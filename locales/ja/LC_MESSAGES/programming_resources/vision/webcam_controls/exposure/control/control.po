"Exposure is the amount of light that reaches the webcam sensor. It is an "
"important part of how bright or dark your image appears."

msgid ""
"Exposure varies directly with the amount of time that the shutter is "
"open, allowing light to enter and reach the sensor. So, the interface "
"ExposureControl uses a single value of **duration**, in units of time "
"that you specify, typically ``TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS``."

msgid ""
"For example, at a frame rate of 60 frames per second (fps), exposure "
"duration is 1/60 of a second, or 1/60 x 1000 = 16 milliseconds. This "
"basic tutorial does not address frame rate."
