"*FIRST* Tech Challenge seeks to inspire youth to become the next "
"generation of STEM leaders and innovators through participation in "
"mentor-guided robotics competition. Teams who participate in *FIRST* Tech"
" Challenge must build a robot that performs a variety of tasks. The tasks"
" vary from season to season, and are based on a set of game rules that "
"are published at the start of each season. The more tasks that a robot "
"can complete, the more points a team will earn."

"A *FIRST* Tech Challenge match has an AUTO phase and a TELEOP phase. In "
"the AUTO phase of a match the robot operates without any human input or "
"control. In the TELEOP phase, the robot can receive input from up to two "
"human drivers."

msgid ""
"One Android device is mounted onto the robot and is called the *Robot "
"Controller*. In most cases, the ROBOT CONTROLLER is integrated into the "
"REV Robotics Control Hub. The Robot Controller acts as the “brains” of "
"the robot. It does all of the thinking for the robot and tells the robot "
"what to do. It consists of an Android device running a Robot Controller "
"app. Many Teams will also connect a REV Robotics Expansion Hub for "
"additional ports to connect motors, servos and sensors to the ROBOT."

"A second Android device sits with the team drivers and has one or two "
"gamepads connected. This second device is known as the DRIVER STATION. "
"The DRIVER STATION is like a remote control that you might use to control"
" your television. The DRIVER STATION allows a team to communicate "
"remotely (using a secure, wireless connection) to the Robot Controller "
"and to issue commands to the Robot Controller. The DRIVER STATION "
"consists of an Android device running an Driver Station app. Most teams "
"use a REV Robotics Driver Hub, but select Android smartphones are also "
"supported."

"The REV Robotics Control Hub or Expansion Hub is the electronic "
"input/output (or “I/O”) module that lets the Robot Controller talk to the"
" robot’s motors, servos, and sensors. The Robot Controller is integrated "
"into the Control Hub, and communicates with the Expansion Hub through a "
"serial connection. For the situation where an Android smartphone is used "
"as the Robot Controller, a USB cable is used to establish the serial "
"connection."

"The Control Hub and Expansion Hub are also connected to a 12V battery "
"which is used to power the Control Hub, the Expansion Hub, the motors, "
"the servos and sensors. If an Android smartphone is used as the Robot "
"Controller, then the smartphone will have its own independent battery."

msgid ""
"During a typical *FIRST* Tech Challenge match, a team’s robot has to "
"perform a variety of tasks in an effort to score points. For example, a "
"team might want their robot to follow a white line on the competition "
"floor and then score a game element (such as a ball) into a goal "
"autonomously during a match. Teams write “OpModes” (which stand for "
"“operational modes”) to specify the behavior for their robot."

"An *OpMode* is a computer program that is used to customize the behavior "
"of a competition robot. The Robot Controller can *execute* a selected "
"OpMode to perform certain tasks during a match."

"Teams who are participating in *FIRST* Tech Challenge have a variety of "
"programming tools that they can use to create their own OpMode. Teams can"
" use a visual (“drag and drop”) programming tool called the *Blocks "
"Programming Tool* to create their op modes. Teams can also use a text-"
"based Java tool known as the *OnBot Java Programming Tool* or Google’s "
"*Android Studio* integrated development environment (also known as an "
"“IDE”) to create their OpModes."
