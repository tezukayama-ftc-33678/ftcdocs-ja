"The required **annotation** ``@ExportToBlocks`` has optional fields, "
"which may be listed in any order. These fields allow a myBlock to have a "
"custom **comment**, **tooltip**, and **parameter labels**."

msgid "Comment"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:14
msgid ""
"The **comment** text appears in a balloon when the Blocks user clicks the"
" blue question-mark icon. Tell the user **how to use your myBlock**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Must be entered on a **single line**, with no ‘line breaks’. This "
"requirement can be met by **joining text strings**; an example is "
":ref:`here <programming_resources/shared/myblocks/hardware_example"
"/hardware-example:hardware example: control a servo>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:20

"The blue icon will appear only if a custom comment is specified. The "
"Blocks user can add and remove the blue icon, and can edit its text in "
"the (re-sizeable) balloon."

msgid "Tooltip"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:27
msgid ""
"A **tooltip** appears with a **mouseover**: hovering the mouse cursor "
"over an image or icon. Every Block has a short tooltip to **indicate its "
"purpose**."

"If a custom tooltip is not specified, the default tooltip will name the "
"method, its enclosing class, and return type."

"Another tooltip, for the grey input socket (at right), is auto-generated "

"Multiple labels are separated by a comma. Line breaks may be used between"

"For a single parameter, this also works: ``parameterLabels = "
"\"sampleParameter\"``."

msgid ""
"In the Hello World example, you may have noticed that the parameter label"
" **Recipient** was not the same as the Java input parameter name "
"**greetingRecipient**. They don’t need to be the same. One is for the "
"Blocks user, the other is for the Java programmer. Just list them in the "
"correct/same order, so their meanings correspond."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:52
msgid ""
"In fact you don’t need to label every input; a default label will instead"
" show the declared type (e.g. String, boolean, int, double, etc.). In any"
" case each grey socket will contain a sample of the required type (e.g. "
"A, false, 0), with an appropriate tooltip."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:57
msgid ""
"If the number of parameter labels does not match the actual number of "
"Java parameters, **all** custom label will be ignored. Instead the "
"default labels will be displayed."

"A myBlock may have up to 21 parameters… not recommended! Keep things "
"simple."

"Again, the annotation ``@ExportToBlocks`` **must** appear immediately "
"before each myBlock method, even if not using the optional fields."

msgid "Two more optional annotation labels, not illustrated here, are:"

"Java method”."

"``color``, without quotes, just a color number (hue). For example 155 is "
"green, 255 is blue. Default is 289. Check it out!"
