"FTC **timers** offer much more capability than the familiar ``.sleep`` "
"Block. Java programmers can learn about timers from `this Blocks tutorial"
" <https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Timers-"
"in-FTC-Blocks>`__; you can easily apply its lessons to Java programs."

"When creating myBlocks, be careful when converting or ‘packaging’ a "
"section of existing Java code into a myBlock method. As a programmer, you"
" must consider **where** your myBlock might be placed in the OpMode. For "
"example, if the myBlock is placed inside a **repeat while loop**, the "
"Java method will be called many times – this may or may not be what you "
"intended. Use the annotation **comment** to tell the Blocks user how your"
" myBlock should be run, including looping (or not)."

"A particular caution with timers: creating or **instantiating** a new FTC"
" timer also starts or **resets** that timer. If a timer is created inside"
" a myBlock that’s used in a Blocks **repeat loop**, that timer will "
"constantly reset and never advance to the intended time limit."

"Line 15: this single line of Java does all this: - declare a field called"
" myStopwatch, of type (class) ElapsedTime - the field is **private**, can"
" be used only in this class SampleMyBlocks - the field is **static**, can"
" be used in static methods such as myBlocks - call the **constructor** "
"method ElapsedTime() to **instantiate** a **new** ElapsedTime instance - "
"assign that **instance** to the field myStopwatch"

"Lines 18-19 again show two strings of text (each in quotes), joined with "

"alternate way to meet the requirement that a comment field must be a "
"**single line** of text, with no ‘line break’."

"Line 22: this method has **no inputs** (empty parentheses) and **no "

"So, what was the danger? A programmer might naturally place Line 15 "
"**inside** the method, perhaps at Line 23. But that would reset the timer"
" at every cycle of the **repeat while** loop. The stopwatch would always "
"show **zero**."

"Or, a programmer might use Line 15 to **replace** Line 29, since they “do"
" the same thing”. But the object **myStopwatch** is needed at Line 24 "
"also, for telemetry. Moving the telemetry to be **after** Line 29 does "
"not help. If the operator has not yet pressed gamepad button X, the "
"object does not exist and the program will crash."

"When you clicked “Build Everything” in OnBot Java, all of the code in "
