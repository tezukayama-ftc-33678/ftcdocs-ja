"Your Java class may also contain methods that are not myBlocks. Consider "
"this if you have multiple myBlocks that perform a shared internal process"
" or calculation. This is a good programming practice in general, not "
"specifically related to myBlocks."

"To illustrate, consider the Driving Example above. Imagine you want to "
"create myBlocks to support **two** different robots. - Robot A has "
"**4-inch** drive wheels with AndyMark **NeveRest 40** motors. - Robot B "
"has **3-inch** drive wheels with NeveRest **Orbital 20** motors. - You "
"want the myBlocks to be **very simple** for your Blocks programming "
"teammates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/method_example/method-example.rst:16
msgid ""
"Your solution: - One MyBlock per robot. - Each Blocks user needs to "
"specify only the distance to drive, in inches. - Each myBlock uses the "
"appropriate wheel size and motor encoder CPR. - The myBlocks share a "
"‘utility’ method to convert distance to encoder counts."

"Line 34 shows the shared method that is **not** a myBlock. Simply omit "
"the annotation @ExportToBlocks. The keyword ``private`` means the method "
"can be called only from inside the same class. Use this whenever "
"possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/method_example/method-example.rst:28
msgid ""
"Lines 17 and 29 call the shared method. The method calls provide 3 "
"parameters, which do not have the same **names** as the input parameters "
"of the ‘utility’ method – but their types should match."

msgid ""
"At line 38, **(int)** converts, or **casts**, a decimal number to integer"
" type. This is called **type casting**. Programmers must pay close "
"attention to compatible data types. For example, a DC motor ``set "
".TargetPosition`` Block should be given an encoder value as a simple "
"integer, not a decimal number."

"At line 15 and others, the keyword ``final`` indicates a Java "
"**constant**: a variable that cannot change value. Java constants are "
"traditionally ALL CAPS. Can you find the Math constant in this program?"
