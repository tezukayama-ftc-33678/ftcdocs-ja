"Started in the 2023-2024 season, Tech Tips are segments released in the "

" included in whole in the email blast, but sometimes there is more "

"Did you know there's a powerful tool lurking within your FTC Driver "
"Station App, designed to help your team dominate match timing? Forget the"
" need for complex event software – your Driver Station has a built-in "
"Practice Match timer that simulates the entire match flow, or any part of"
" it! Imagine perfecting your autonomous routine, nailing the Auto-TeleOp "
"transition, or optimizing your endgame strategy, all without the pressure"
" of a real competition. This (not so) hidden gem allows teams to practice"
" match timing for every critical phase:"

"*How does it work?* In the upper-left corner of the Driver Station App "
"you will see the \"Practice Timer Window\". This has the heading "
"\"Practice Timer\" and has the remaining time (in a possible practice "
"match) as well as a \"PLAY\" button. This Practice Timer area is always "
"visible regardless of what OpModes are running or any other activities "
"(on the same screen). This Practice Timer also runs independently of "
"other activities, therefore OpModes can be selected, started, stopped, "
"reselected, and so on while the Practice Timer is running without "
"affecting the timer."
