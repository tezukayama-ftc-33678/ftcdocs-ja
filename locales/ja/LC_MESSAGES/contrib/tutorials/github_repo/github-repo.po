"This main **code page** is where you'll do most of your work. It's called"
" a **code page** because by default the ``< > Code`` tab of the "
"repository is selected, and this is the page that we're currently "
"viewing. For software projects, the **code page** is where code is "
"stored; for us, this is where our *content* is stored. There are several "
"different tabs, but we only really care about the first four:"
