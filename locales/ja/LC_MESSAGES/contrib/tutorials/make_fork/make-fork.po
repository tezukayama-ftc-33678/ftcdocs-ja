"Forking a repository is a simple process. It creates a copy of the "
"repository in your account, and you can make changes to it without "
"affecting the original repository. You can also submit a pull request to "
"the original repository to propose changes to the original repository. It"
" also allows you to easily keep your forked repository up to date with "
"the original repository."
