"From the outset, let me say that \"reStructured Text\" is probably a bit "
"of a misnomer. It's more like \"Text\" that uses certain consistent "
"patterns (also known as *markup*) in order to instruct a tool on how that"
" text should ultimately look or feel - for example, whether or not a "
"passage should be *italicized*, **bolded**, or if an image should be "
"displayed in that location in the final document. ReStructured Text is "
"used to generate *minimally-interactive web pages*, PDF documents, and "
"other forms of output in such a way that no actual web programming or PDF"
" publishing experience is necessary AND is still human-readable. In this "
"way, reStructured Text can literally be written once and then exported to"
" lots of different formats and platforms. Comparable web programming and "
"PDF authoring tools are not, in the opinion of this author, readable by "
"the average person and cannot be easily translated between output formats"
" whereas \"reStructured Text\" is."

"Now a very brief history lesson: In the early 1990's the first "
"\"Structured Text\" markup languages were developed - these languages "
"were used to help develop different kinds of program documentation for "
"the quickly developing software industry. This created a universal "
"standard for adding symbols and directives to plain text so that it could"
" be processed by generic tools. This way the documentation could be read "
"and formatted any way a user or company wanted - it could be converted "
"into printer commands for printing onto paper, it could be rendered onto "
"a screen, it could be read aloud by a text-to-voice system, or it could "
"be used in lots of other ways. Unfortunately, as is usual in this "
"business, the tools quickly became too complicated or not flexible enough"
" for the needs of its users. In the early 2000's, elements of "
"\"Structured Text\" were \"revised, reworked, and reinterpreted\" into a "
"new format, which ultimately became called \"reStructured Text\" (rST)."

"following::"
