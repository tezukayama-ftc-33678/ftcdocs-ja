"Branches can be thought of as parallel versions of a project. This is "
"useful for deveopment because it allows you to work on a feature or bug "
"fix in an isolated environment without affecting the main project. Once "
"you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back "
"into the main branch to publish your changes. In the case of the FTC "
"Docs, the main branch of your fork should always be a copy of the main "
"branch of the main repository which serves as a reference point to create"
" new branches from. After we are satisfied with the changes we've made in"
" our branch, we will create a Pull Request to merge our changes back into"
" the main branch of the :term:`Main Repository <Main Repository>`. After "
"the Pull Request is approved, the changes will be merged into the main "
"branch of the Main Repository and will be published to the FTC Docs "
"website. After the changes are merged, we will use the process described "
"in the :doc:`/contrib/tutorials/update_fork/update-fork`"

"In order to make any changes to the content, we need to create ourselves "
"a new branch so that we have our own workspace in which to make changes. "
"To create a new branch duplicated from ``main``, we need to ensure "
"``main`` is the currently selected branch (if there's only one branch "
"then it's got to be ``main``) and then we can type a new name in the box "
"and click the \"create\" selection that will appear. Let's call this new "
"branch ``demo``. For real work you should use a more descriptive name, "
"like ``feature-<FEATURE_NAME>``, ``bugfix-<BUG_NUMBER>``, or "
"``<YOUR_NAME>-<FEATURE_NAME>``."
