"The Hub has 4 independent digital input/output (I/O) ports. Each port has"
" two digital I/O pins for a total of 8 digital I/O pins on a Hub. You "
"will connect a REV Robotics Touch sensor to one of the digital I/O ports."

"Note that in the case of the REV Robotics Touch Sensor, the device has a "
"connector port for a 4-pin sensor cable. However, the device only needs "
"to connect to one of the two available digital I/O pins. For the REV "
"Robotics Touch Sensor, the second digital I/O pin in the port is the one "
"that gets connected when a standard REV Robotics 4-pin JST PH cable is "
"used. For the \"0-1\" port, it is the pin labeled \"1\" that gets "
"connected through the 4-pin cable. Similarly, for the \"2-3\" port, it is"
" the pin labeled \"3\" that gets connected through the 4-pin cable."
