"A REV Control Hub combines a REV Expansion Hub with an embedded Android "
"daughterboard connected to it.  This means it is able to control all of "
"the hardware components of your robot and also run your actual robot "
"software.  This is in contrast to the REV Expansion Hub which was only "
"able to control hardware devices but is not able to to interpret and run "
"the SDK."

"A REV Expansion Hub is a hub that is used to control all of the hardware "
"components of your robot. It takes the commands your Android Device sends"
" and actually makes it happen. If you want to move a motor, an Expansion "
"Hub is what takes the instruction of moving the motor and actually sends "
"power to the motor in the correct manner. It however does not know when "
"to do this which is where the Android Device comes into play. This device"
" can either be a traditional Android Phone connected via USB or just the "
"embedded device in a Control Hub. When using more than one hub, these "
"hubs can be connected via ``RS485`` or USB. More information can be found"
