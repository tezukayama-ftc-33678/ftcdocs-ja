"Far and above, the most important factor regarding the safety of COTS USB"
" Battery Packs is ensuring that the battery pack was manufactured by a "

" That's not always an easy thing to determine, however brands such as "
"`Anker <https://www.anker.com/collections/power-banks>`__, `Belkin "

"*FIRST* Tech Challenge recommends choosing an internationally reputable "

"How do you calculate Watt-hours? To calculate Watt-hours of a battery, "

"capacity - when capacity is measured in milli-Amp Hours (mAh), divide the"

"COTS USB Battery Packs, the Voltage cells predominantly used in the packs"
" is **3.7V**, regardless of the ultimate Voltage provided by the USB "
"ports. Therefore to calculate Wh for a COTS USB Battery Pack, multiply "
"**3.7V** by the **Ah rating** of the pack. A 25,000mAh COTS USB Battery "
"Pack has a rating of 92.5Wh. Using this formula, the maximum capacity "
