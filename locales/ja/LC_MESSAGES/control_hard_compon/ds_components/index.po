"These images represent a basic connection diagram for the components that"
" have typically been used to create a Driver Station. These components "
"have typically been purchased from the *FIRST* Storefront (in the "
"\"Control and Communication\" kit). These configurations show sample "
"connections, and in no way represent the only possible way of connecting "
"these components. These images also do not represent using a `Driver "
"Station Carrier <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3386378>`_, which is "
"recommended for teams to use for component management and transportation."
" See the Competition Manual for more information on *OPERATOR CONSOLES*."
