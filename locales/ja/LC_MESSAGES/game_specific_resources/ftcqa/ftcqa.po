"Once the `Game Q&A <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/>`_ opens for the "
"season (usually within 2-3 weeks of the challenge being announced) teams "
"may ask questions using unique accounts provided to teams via their "
"`FIRST Dashboard <https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/>`_ accounts. "
"Teams must use these credentials to log into the system, and then may ask"
" questions. Anyone may create a personal account and view or tag "
"questions, but only accounts provided to teams may ask questions."

"Obtaining the team credentials for the question-asking team accounts can "

"Codes\" from the \"Payment & Product\" drop-down in the \"Team Options\" "
"column of the team information in the `FIRST Dashboard "
"<https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/>`_. The Q&A website credentials "
"for the team will be listed under the \"Game Q&A Forum Accounts\" section"
