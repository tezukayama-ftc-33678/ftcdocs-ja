"Many parts in FTC need to be a special/unique shape and size, one that "
"isn't sold or available from a vendor. Sometimes, teams need a part that "
"is impossible to machine or cut out, or needs to be lightweight. Other "
"times, teams may want to test and iterate the design of a part rapidly "
"and cheaply. 3D printing is a great solution to all of these problems."

"3D Printing is the process of creating a three dimensional object by "
"laying down successive layers of material (typically plastic) from a "
"digital model file. To do this, machines known as 3D Printers are "
"employed which melt and place plastic in order to produce this model."
