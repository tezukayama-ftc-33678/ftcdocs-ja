"There are numerous kinds of 3D printing, but for FTC there are only a few"
" that are practical. The most common is **Fused Deposition Modeling "
"(FDM)**. FDM printers melt a plastic filament and extrude it through a "
"nozzle, which moves around to create the part. FDM printers are the most "
"common type of printer used, and the most practical for robotics teams, "
"so this guide will focus on them."

"Other types of printers include SLA (Stereolithography) and SLS "
"(Selective Laser Sintering), however these are often more expensive, "
"difficult to use, and have less use in FTC, although they have a few "
"specific niches, such as very high precision details."

"3D printed parts can be infinitely customized and optimized for a "

"3D printing can be used to create parts that adapt between different "

"standards for mounting holes, shaft sizes, or other dimensions. 3D "

"3D printed parts are often not as strong as machined or cut parts. This "
"is especially true for FDM printers, which have a layer-by-layer "
"structure that can be a weak point if the part is loaded in a certain "
"way. If consideration is given to this weakness when designing the part, "
"however, the result can be made very strong."

"A 3D printed part can only be as large as the print bed it is printed on."
" This means that large parts may need to be printed in multiple pieces "
"and assembled later."
