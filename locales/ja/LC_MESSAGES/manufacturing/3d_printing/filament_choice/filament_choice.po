"There are many different materials and colors of plastics called "
"\"filaments\" that can be used for 3D printing, but for FTC there are "
"only a few that are of practical use for most teams. Since this guide is "
"currently only addressing FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printing, "
"materials like resin (used in SLA printing) will not be discussed. |"

"Currently, the majority of commercial 3D printers use a 1.75mm diameter "
"filament, so when shopping for filaments, teams should take care to avoid"
" other diameters, such as 2.85mm, as these will not work with most "
"printers."

"This section is all about FDM filament choices for 3D printing. There are"
" a variety of plastics that are commonly used, with some being more "
"common than others, and some fulfilling specialty use cases. There are "
"specialized to FTC descriptions in this section, but if you want a simple"
" comparison chart like shown below, check out this `Filament Properties "
