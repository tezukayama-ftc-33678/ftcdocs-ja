"This guide is primarily for older printers that don't have automatic "
"leveling. If you have a newer printer, this process is likely not needed "
"or there is a more advanced process to follow. Research what processes "
"are available for your printer."

"If you have a bed thats adjustable by screws, bed leveling is by far the "
"biggest factor for how well your prints stick across the whole bed. The "
"only tool you should need is a 0.2mm thick piece of metal, a piece of "
"cardstock, or an index card."

"Once your printer is leveled between the screws, the bed is flat, but "
"it's not always at exactly the right height. All printers should have a Z"
" offset variable that lets you adjust the height of the nozzle during or "
"before printing. If at the start of your print the bed is either located "
"too high or too low, but remaining consistent (provided you bed leveled),"
" use your printers Z offset feature (also called baby-stepping) to adjust"
" it live while it lays down the first layer. Reference the images below "
"for some good visualizations on how to make sure you're at the proper "
"height!"
