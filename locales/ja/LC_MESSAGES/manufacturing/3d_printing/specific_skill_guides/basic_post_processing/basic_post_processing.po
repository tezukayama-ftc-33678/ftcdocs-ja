"Support material removal is a basic form of post processing where, as the"
" name suggests, you remove support material from your print. This can "
"typically be done easily with either just your fingers or a pair of "
"pliers/flush cutters, however, sometimes removing support from small "
"features or holes can be difficult. This is why it's recommended to "
"design away from using supports, and if you must use them, to set up your"
" slicing settings properly in order to make them easy to remove."

"Drilling out printed holes are typically used in order to widen screw "
"holes to achieve a loose fit. This can be done with any drill and "
"properly sized drill bit, however take your time while drilling to ensure"
" that the drill bit is lined up properly to guaruntee that drilled holes "
"are straight."

"Brims are used to have more surface area for your print to contact the "
"build plate. To remove them, you typically just use your fingers, "
"however, if your Z-Offset is too low, it may be easier to use a deburring"
" tool to remove the inner layer lines of the brim."
