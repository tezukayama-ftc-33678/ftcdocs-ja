"What I didn’t know was that minor variances in how batteries are "
"manufactured, especially in lower-voltage Li-Ion batteries, can affect "
"the voltage stability of the battery as it depletes (how the voltage of a"

"and differences in a battery’s specific internal resistance and other "
"factors will cause each battery to have different behavior (this occurs "
"in all batteries, but higher capacity batteries with low internal "

"When a team replaces the primary battery with a spare, the Driver Hub "

" battery and shutting down before the battery has fully depleted, or "
"thinking there’s more battery left when there really isn’t. If the new "

"A servo connection is a 3-wire combination that combines power, ground, "
"and a signal. The actual command signal for the servo travels on the "
"signal wire, and the power used to power the servo travels on the other "
"two wires. A servo power injector is a device that removes the power "
"provided by the servo controller (REV Control Hub or REV Expansion Hub "
"for FTC) and provides a new, usually higher wattage power source. Both "
"the REV Servo Power Module and Studica Servo Power Block replace the "
"5V/10W power provided by the REV Control/Expansion Hubs with a 6V power "
"source with a higher maximum wattage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tech_tips/tech-tips.rst:220
msgid ""
"So what does higher voltage do for a servo? Servos operate on a power "
"range; the more power they get, the faster and stronger they can become, "
"up to a certain limit. Servos operating at 5V get a noticeable boost in "
"speed and output power when used at 6V. The same servos may seem "
"superhuman at higher voltages!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The downside of servo power injectors is that teams are now responsible "
"for managing their own power usage. On the REV Control Hub, for instance,"
" each servo port pair is limited in how much power it can draw (at least "
"there’s a limit on how long it can draw high loads). When using a servo "
"power injector, the pool of power for a servo is much larger and less "
"restricted since it pulls its power directly from the robot battery - "
"using power injectors means you could consume all of the power on the "
"robot just from the servos alone! This will result in the robot power "
"system browning out (resulting in loss of communications or loss of power"
" to the control system) or even blowing the 20A battery fuse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tech_tips/tech-tips.rst:235
msgid ""
"Using a servo power injector can also expose different behaviors in "
"servos that were not present when using the REV Control/Expansion Hub "
"directly. The biggest behavior is the “Lost Signal” behavior. When an "
"OpMode ends, the REV Control/Expansion hubs stop the signal and also cut "
"power to the servo ports - this leads to the servos “going limp” as they "
"lose power. With a servo power injector, the servos never lose power, and"
" so “lost signal” behaviors will often then take over which may cause the"
" servo to move to a “default” position (which is virtually never "
"advantageous for robots but definitely advantageous for R/C planes for "
"example). The Axon MAX+ servo and several higher-power HiTec servos have "
"this behavior, the Axon MAX+ behavior is at least configurable with a "
"servo programmer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tech_tips/tech-tips.rst:247
msgid ""
"Finally, when using a servo power injector it’s of VITAL importance that "
"you cover unused ports with tape or other debris-limiting measures to "
"protect the ports. It’s very easy to get metal swarf in open servo ports,"
" and that metal can short out the power output pins - especially lower-"
"cost power injectors cannot tell when they’re being used, or don’t have "
"protections against short circuits, but they still have all output pins "
"powered. This can quickly turn your servo power injector into an "
"expensive paperweight when the power regulator overloads and burns out."

"The fundamental concept we need to understand is power. We are generally "

"power**, which is the rate at which the motor performs work by rotating a"

" electrical power deals with the movement of electrical charges, and "
"mechanical power deals with the movement of objects due to forces. Both "

"power, in general, is defined as the rate of energy transfer or work "
"done. No matter the form of energy (electrical, mechanical, thermal, "

"Understanding IR requires talking about the discharge rate of a battery. "
"The discharge rate is a measure of how quickly the battery can deliver "
"its stored energy. Most NiMH batteries used in FIRST Tech Challenge are "
"rated at a nominal 12V and a maximum discharge rate of 30A, though that "
"rate is limited by the 20A fuse. A battery’s IR refers to any opposition "
"to that flow of electric current within the battery itself. Resistance "
"can come from a number of sources, such as resistance within the "
"battery’s chemistry (such as a breakdown of the conductive electrolyte "
"within the battery), changes to the resistance of the electrodes (such as"
" a buildup of crystals around the electrodes), resistance added due to "
"connectors and wiring, and others. Rising IR affects the battery "
"performance primarily in decreasing the Voltage and Current that the "
"battery can provide, and causes the battery to generate excess heat when "
"used. The starting IR of a battery can vary among different manufacturing"
" processes and batches, so much that batteries should have their IR "

"Battery cell health is an important factor in the overall health of a "
"battery. An NiMH battery used in FIRST Tech Challenge is a multi-cell "
"battery, meaning it’s composed of individual smaller batteries connected "
"together. Each cell contributes to the overall power output of the "
"battery. As a battery ages, individual cells in the battery may age at "
"different rates - this aging can lead to degradation of cell material, "
"electrolyte breakdown, and creation of dendrites that can eventually "
"puncture the cell wall from inside the cell among others. Most often this"
" cell breakdown is accelerated due to improper storage, overcharging, "
"deep discharging, excessive temperatures, or physical damage (especially "
"due to dropping). When a cell fails, it can lead to a reduced capacity of"
" the battery pack, and the battery will not last as long on a single "
"charge nor will it be able to provide the peak power output that it "
"previously could. Failed cells can cause other cells to fail prematurely,"
" primarily due to overcharging and imbalanced voltage due to the fact "
"that NiMH batteries and chargers for NiMH batteries do not contain a "
"load-balancing management system for individual cells. In some cases, "
"failed cells can cause short circuits, overheating, and increased risk of"
" fire/explosion! If you’re suspicious of a battery, get it tested before "
"using it again."

"Battery temperature is also an important consideration. When a battery is"
" being charged, it will likely become warm and even slightly hot to the "
"touch - this is expected and natural due to the process of recharging a "
"battery. NiMH batteries deliver their best performance at moderate "
"temperatures. When a battery is hot from charging, its internal "
"resistance increases (we’ll cover internal resistance in a future "
"segment) which can lead to reduced power output. Allowing the battery to "
"cool down before use helps to ensure optimal performance. This process of"
" allowing the battery to cool down before use can also prolong the life "
"of the battery. This advice should also be tempered with the knowledge "
"that most modern NiMH batteries are generally designed to handle some "
"degree of heat; if you need to use the battery immediately after "
"charging, it’s usually safe to do so as long as the battery is not "
"excessively hot to the touch. However, understand that it may not provide"
" the maximum level of power output as it would have if it had cooled "

"The first thing to remember is that a battery is a chemical reaction "

"potential difference (voltage) between them. This voltage drives the flow"

" and energy. What’s important to understand is that the chemical reaction"
" can happen only at a specific rate (the rate is based on a number of "
"factors which we’ll discuss later); if the demand exceeds the rate of "
"reaction for the battery, the voltage and current will drop until the "
"reactions can replenish the battery output (this temporary drop is known "

"So what is the biggest reason why batteries will sag? On a FIRST Tech "
"Challenge robot, this reason is actuator (motor and servo) current draw. "
"Motors and Servos can pull a considerable amount of current when they’re "

"configurations. Motors that are geared closer to 1:1 gear ratio can spin "
"faster - they can propel your robot’s drivetrain across the field much "
"faster - but have less torque because of the lower gear ratio. Motor "
"configurations that have less torque consume significantly more current "
"to operate (when driving the same load) than motor configurations with "
"more torque. Systems being driven by actuators that have more friction or"
" less torque will cause the motors to consume larger amounts of current, "
"and this can cause even healthy batteries to have their voltages “sag” "
"during periods of high use. Teams must consider their power consumption "

"a logarithmic scale, so comparing dBm values differs from what you would "
"normally consider on a linear scale. Increments of 3dBm indicate "
"doubling/halving signal strength, and increments of 10dBm indicate 10x "
"change in signal strength. For example, a signal strength of -40dBm is "
"twice as strong as a signal strength of -43dBm, and a signal strength of "
"-67dBm is one-tenth the signal strength of -57dBm. Signal strengths "
"around -40dBm are Amazing, but rarely achievable in match play. A "
"strength of -60dBm is still considered Very Good. -67dBm is considered "
"Good. -70dBm is considered Okay. Anything less than -80dBm is considered "

"Resistive Grounding Strap (RGS) is the only FTC-legal means of providing "
"a grounding option for your robot frame or connected structural elements."
" Static electricity has two basic behaviors depending on whether it’s "
"building up on a conductive or non-conductive surface; on non-conductive "

"up in “pools”, on conductive surfaces like most metals static electricity"
" spreads and distributes across the entire surface of the material. "
"Aluminum extrusion used on robots typically has a clear non-conductive "

" under the layer is conductive. When using the RGS, it’s important to "

"the ring terminal on the RGS to different places on the robot to "

"resistor (with a ~5% tolerance) in-line in the strap - if not using an "
"auto-range multimeter, be sure to select a range above 600 Ohms to ensure"
" the resistivity is measured properly. It may be necessary to scrape the "
"aluminum to create a conductive path between multiple segments of "
"aluminum, just remember that a non-conductive oxide layer will eventually"
" form on the exposed aluminum. Remember that if you're probing aluminum "
"extrusion to check for continuity or resistivity, those areas need to be "

"This week’s Tech Tip of the Week is an extension to our first-ever Tech "
"Tip of the Week regarding battery maintenance. Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH"
" or Ni-MH) batteries, like those used in FIRST Tech Challenge, do require"
" periodic maintenance to keep them healthy! Every day, NiMH batteries "
"lose on average 1% of their charge capacity at normal room temperature - "
"at colder temperatures this decline slows a bit but does not stop it. "
"This means that every 2-3 months it’s important to recharge your "
"batteries to keep them healthy - there is no off-season for batteries! "
"It’s also recommended to mark your batteries with tape and a sharpie to "
"mark (1) Your team number (never lose a battery at a competition!), (2) "
"What year the battery was purchased, (3) Give your batteries names so you"
" can differentiate batteries easily, and (4) optionally provide a tick "
"mark each time the battery is recharged. NiMH batteries can generally "
"last 200-300 recharge cycles before their internal resistance declines to"
" the point where it’s time to replace them, and keeping track of charge "
"cycles is an easy way to track how “used” the battery is before needing "
"to have its internal resistance checked."
