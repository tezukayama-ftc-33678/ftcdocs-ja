"An encoder is a device that measures the rotational displacement around "
"an axis.  Most legal *FIRST* Tech Challenge motors contain a built in "
"quadrature encoder that is compatible with a REV Hub. It is also possible"
" to use a standalone incremental encoder like a REV Through Bore Encoder "
"(shown above). An incremental encoder works by sending out a \"tick\" per"
" partial rotation of the shaft. More information on how many ticks are "
"output per rotation can be found on the manufacturer's website. An "
"absolute encoder is able to indicate the displacement of the shaft from "
"its starting position and the the exact angle the shaft is currently at "
"relative to a \"zero\" position."
