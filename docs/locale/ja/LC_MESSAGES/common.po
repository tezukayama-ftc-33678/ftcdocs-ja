"FTC Docs aims to provide a comprehensive documentation base for *FIRST* "
"Tech Challenge teams and mentors. It is a community-driven project, "
"hosted and moderated by FIRST Tech Challenge staff, and we welcome "
"contributions from all teams and mentors. It is our hope that this "
"project will help to make the community more connected and informed while"
" reducing the fragmentation of documentation present in *FIRST* Tech "
"Challenge. The information provided is not meant to endorse any specific "
"method or approach, but rather to provide an information base for "
"students and mentors to make informed decisions."
