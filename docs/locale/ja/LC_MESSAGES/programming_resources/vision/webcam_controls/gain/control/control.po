"Gain is a digital camera setting that controls the amplification of the "
"signal from the webcam sensor. This amplifies the whole signal, including"
" any associated background noise."

msgid ""
"Gain can be managed in coordination with exposure. Raising exposure and "
"keeping gain low, can provide a bright image and low noise. On the other "
"hand, longer exposure can cause motion blur, which may affect target "
"tracking performance. In some cases, reducing exposure duration and "
"increasing gain may provide a sharper image, although with more noise."

"The interface GainControl uses a single value to control gain. It’s used "
"for amplification, and thus has no units – it’s just a number of type "
"integer. Its methods are:"
