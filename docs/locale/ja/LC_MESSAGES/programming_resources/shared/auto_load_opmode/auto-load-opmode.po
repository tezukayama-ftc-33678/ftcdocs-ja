"A FIRST Tech Challenge match consists of a 30 second autonomous period "
"followed by a 2 minute driver controlled (i.e., tele-operated or teleop) "
"period. Previously, teams had to manually select their teleop op mode "
"after the autonomous portion their match was over."

"Teams can now preselect their teleop op mode, and have the Driver Station"
" automatically load this op mode as soon as their autonomous run has "
"completed. This feature can help a team avoid selecting the wrong op mode"
