msgid ""
"If you edit and re-Build a myBlock’s Java code, you might need to "
"**replace** that myBlock in the Blocks OpMode. It depends on whether you "
"change the myBlock’s visible or external features: annotation fields, "
"input parameters or returned outputs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/editing/editing.rst:9
msgid ""
"If your Java change does affect external features, its updated myBlock is"
" available only from the Java Classes menu in Blocks. Any such myBlock "
"**already placed in an OpMode** is obsolete and may generate a **Blocks "
"warning**; replace it with the new myBlock. In some cases you may need to"
" re-open the OpMode from the top-level Blocks listing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/editing/editing.rst:17
msgid ""
"If your edit affects only the myBlock’s **internal** processing, it might"
" update automatically after “Build Everything”, without needing a fresh "
"replacement from the Java Classes menu. In some cases you might not even "
"need to click Save OpMode in the Blocks screen – you could simply re-run "
"the OpMode on the Driver Station with INIT and Start. This can allow very"
" fast testing of minor/internal changes to the myBlock."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/editing/editing.rst:24
msgid ""
"In any case, consider adding **versions** to your myBlock names, such as "
"myGreeting_v01. Copy and paste before editing, to keep all related "
"myBlock methods in the **same Java class**. In Blocks, all uniquely named"
" versions will be available in the Java Classes menu, under that single "
"class name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/editing/editing.rst:30
msgid ""
"Keep the class name **short and generic**, such as MyBlocks, "
"SampleMyBlocks, Team8604MyBlocks, DrivingMyBlocks, etc. It will contain "
"all or many related myBlocks, not just one myBlock per the simple "
"examples above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/editing/editing.rst:35
msgid ""
"In that single class, each myBlock method must appear after its own "
"annotation ``@ExportToBlocks``. That class may contain other methods that"
" are not myBlocks; omit the annotation before any non-myBlock methods. "
"Such methods might be used to initialize variables, or might be (shared) "
"submethods called by one or more myBlocks. An example is shown :ref:`here"
" <programming_resources/shared/myblocks/method_example/method-"
"example:example: non-myblock methods>`."

"This tutorial has covered these basic requirements so far: - create/store"
" in **org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode** folder/package - class **extends "
"BlocksOpModeCompanion** - each myBlock method needs annotation "
"**@ExportToBlocks** - method must be **public** and **static** (must not "
"be abstract) - replace myBlocks after external edits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/programming_resources/shared/myblocks/editing/editing.rst:49
msgid ""
"The rest of this tutorial gives **examples** that you can **re-type in "
"OnBot Java** and **test in Blocks**. Try making changes and adding "
"features!"
