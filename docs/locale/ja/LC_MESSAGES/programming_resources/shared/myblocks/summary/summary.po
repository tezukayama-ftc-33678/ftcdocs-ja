"MyBlocks now provide access to the full range of Java in the Software "
"Development Kit (SDK). Blocks programming can now perform tasks "
"**previously unavailable** to Blocks-only teams. This now includes "
":ref:`External Libraries "

"MyBlocks programming allows some team members to begin learning and using"
" Java, contributing valuable new features. The other team members can "
"continue learning and working in Blocks, producing the team’s official "
"code. Nobody is held back, or left behind."

"MyBlocks can be created with **OnBot Java**, which runs on the RC phone "
"or Control Hub. Building and testing are very fast. Many teams do not "
"have easy access to Android Studio, for reasons including school "
"computers that prevent software installation."

"By developing and sharing myBlocks, experienced teams could **help new "
"teams** in a more direct way, beyond simply posting a link to their Java "
"library. The *FIRST* Tech Challenge community might ultimately benefit "
"from a curated repository for tested, well documented myBlocks.  Perhaps "
"the “Blocks Store”?"
