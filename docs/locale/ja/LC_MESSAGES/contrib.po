" text should ultimately look or feel - for example, whether or not a "

"used to generate *minimally-interactive web pages*, PDF documents, and "

" publishing experience is necessary AND is still human-readable. In this "
"way, reStructured Text can literally be written once and then exported to"
" lots of different formats and platforms. Comparable web programming and "

"Now a very brief history lesson: In the early 1990's the first "
"\"Structured Text\" markup languages were developed - these languages "
"were used to help develop different kinds of program documentation for "
"the quickly developing software industry. This created a universal "
"standard for adding symbols and directives to plain text so that it could"
" be processed by generic tools. This way the documentation could be read "
"and formatted any way a user or company wanted - it could be converted "
"into printer commands for printing onto paper, it could be rendered onto "
"a screen, it could be read aloud by a text-to-voice system, or it could "
"be used in lots of other ways. Unfortunately, as is usual in this "
"business, the tools quickly became too complicated or not flexible enough"
" for the needs of its users. In the early 2000's, elements of "
