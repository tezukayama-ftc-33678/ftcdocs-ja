"PTFE tubing is a common low friction tubing used in 3d printing. PTFE "
"lined hotends have a section of this tubing that goes right up to the "

"beyond PLA/PETG. PTFE at temperatures over standard printing temps "
"(normally ~250C is the limit) can \"off-gas\", putting off dangerous VOCs"
" (Volatile Organic Compounds). All-Metal hotends are more expensive, but "
"remove this dangerous PTFE tube placement. Safety should always be your "

"Cartesian motion 3D printers, otherwise known colloquially as \"bed-"
