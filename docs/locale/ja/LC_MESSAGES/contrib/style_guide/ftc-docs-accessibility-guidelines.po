"The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are part of a series of "
"web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility "
"Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main "
"international standards organization for the Internet. They are a set of "
"recommendations for making Web content more accessible, primarily for "
"people with disabilities — but also for all user agents, including highly"
" limited devices, such as mobile phones. See the `WCAG overview "
"<https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/>`_ for more "
"information about the WCAG standard."
