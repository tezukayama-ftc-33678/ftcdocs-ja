"In order to simplify the process of building and running FTC Docs we have"
" created a set of tasks for Visual Studio Code. These tasks are defined "
"in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file and can be run via the `Terminal` -> "
"`Run Task...` menu."

"This task will build the PDF version of the FTC Docs. The output will be "

"files and then runs `pdflatex` to generate the PDF. This build "
"functionality is not supported in this tutorial though Codespace users "
"can use this task. The PDF output is stored as "
"``docs/build/latex/ftcdocs.pdf``. Note that this task takes a long time "
"to run and is not recommended for frequent use."

"recommended way to view the FTC Docs while working on them. It is also "
"hotkeyed to `Ctrl+Shift+B` for easy access. You can stop this task by "
