"Git is a version control system (VCS) that allows you to track changes to"
" your files within a repository. A repository is a collection of files "
"that are being tracked by Git. You can think of a repository as a folder "
"that contains all of the files that you are working on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/contrib/tutorials/make_pr/make-pr.rst:99
msgid ""
"However, Git does not track every change you make to a file. This is "
"because it would be inefficient to track every change and often "
"distracting. Instead Git tracks changes in snapshots called commits. Each"
" commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in the repository."
" A commit does not contain the entire file but only the changes made to "
"the file. This allows Git to be efficient and fast. You can then think of"
" each commit as a \"Git save\"."

"Before you can commit your changes, we must indicate which files we want "
"to be updated in the commit. This is done by a process known as staging. "
"Why don't we just commit all of the changes? Sometimes you may have "
"changes that you do not want to commit. For example, maybe you deleted a "
"file that you did not mean to delete. In addition, you may not want to "
"commit build files or other temporary files that are not necessary for "
"the repository. Note that we have configured Git to ignore build files so"
" you do not have to worry about them."

"<Fork>` of the :term:`main repository <Main Repository>`. In order for "
