"If your printer's hotend (the part that melts the filament) has a PTFE "
"(Teflon) lining where the PTFE tube goes all the way down to the heat "
"block (common in lower price printers like the base Ender 3), then you "
"should not be printing at or above 250° C. Doing so will cause the PTFE "
"tube to degrade and melt, potentially releasing toxic fumes. If you need "
"to print at these temperatures (used for some of the advanced filaments "
"listed here), and you have a PTFE lined hotend, you can look at upgrading"
" to an all-metal hotend."

"Before PLA became readily available, ABS was the most common filament "
"used for 3D printing. Nowadays, it's regarded as a more advanced filament"
" with a specilized setup needed. ABS is very strong, having a high "
"ductility and able to withstand shock loads well. These strengths come "
"with major difficulties, however, as an enclosure is often needed to "
"increase the ambient temperature in order to prevent severe part warping."
" This enclosure is also a good idea due to ABS's production of styrene "
"when it melts, a carcinogenic gas that can cause headaches. ABS should "
"only be printed within filtered enclosures or in extremely well "
"ventilated areas. If you have a proper setup with a heated enclosure, ABS"
" can be very worth your time, but if you don't have a setup for it, it's "
"not worth the pain to try and print it. Notably, ABS can be very "
"inexpensive and often found near the same price as PLA or even cheaper."

"ASA, a slightly more expensive but similar material, prints at "
"approximately the same temperatures but prints slightly easier and "
"produces considerably less styrene. It also may not require an enclosure "
"for smaller prints. Alongside that, it's UV Resistant and typically "
"offers slightly better mechanical properties compared to most ABS "
"plastics."

"It is important to properly vent/filter fumes emitting from ABS/ASA, as "
"prolonged exposure to either can lead to poisoning. Typically it's "
"recommended to use an activated carbon air filter, however most "

"Being more of a category of filaments, polyamide (PA) based filaments can"
" boast impressive capabilities while being relatively easy to print. "
"These show their strength in extreme durability and resistance to wear, "
"making them ideal for gears and pulleys if you can safely print them. "
"Common filaments in this category include Pure Nylon, Polyamide, PA-KV "
"(kevlar filled nylon), and PA-CF (carbon fiber filled polyamide). "
"Polyamide filaments will commonly require printing temperatures in excess"
" of 250° C, making an all-metal hotend necessary, and require heated bed "
"temperatures in the range of 80-100° C. Some of these filaments are "
"abrasive, requiring a hardened steel nozzle on your hotend to avoid "
"damage. These filaments are also **extremely** hygroscopic, making proper"
" storage a necessity even while actively printing. Nylon prints also tend"
" to shrink when cooling."

"Carbon fiber (CF) filled filaments are everywhere, bringing increased "
"stiffness and strength to many parts while keeping them light. You can "
"find PLA-CF, PETG-CF, PA-CF, CF-ASA, PC-CF, and many others. CF filled "
"filaments typically keep many properties from the filament they are based"
" on, including how hygroscopic the filament is, the printing "
"temperatures, and the ease of printing. The one large difference is the "
"abrasion of the filament, meaning that you need a hardened steel nozzle "
"or other abrasion resistant nozzle for your hotend."

"Carbon Fiber reinforced PLA is one of the most commonly used CF "
"Filaments, but comes with a notable drawback that it becomes incredibly "
"brittle. It's important to to keep these kinds of trade-offs in mind, as "

"regular PLAs when it comes to dealing with impacts and may suffer from "

"TPU and TPE are flexible filaments that can be used to create parts that "

"TPU/TPE's flexibility grants it an extremely high impact resistance, "
