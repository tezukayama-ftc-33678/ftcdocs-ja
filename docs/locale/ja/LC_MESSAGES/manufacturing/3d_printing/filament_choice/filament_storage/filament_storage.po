"It's important to keep in mind that filaments need to be stored in a "
"specific way- and even the basic filaments PLA and PET-G are no "
"exception. Filaments are **hygroscopic** (absorb moisture from the air), "
"and that affects print quality majorly if not taken care of. Store "
"filaments in a closed and sealed container, preferably kept dry with "
"spare silica packets, and don't leave them out whenever possible."

"If you suspect a filament has taken on water, look up a drying "

"An easy way to tell if a filament has taken on moisture is if you hear a "
"slight popping noise when printing- this is the moisture forming bubbles "
"in the filament as it's heated."

"Some more sensitive hygroscopic filaments don't just need to be stored in"
" sealed containers, but also need to be printed while in a sealed "
"container. Lots of companies sell or design \"dryboxes\" for this "
"purpose, such as SUNLU's filament dryer box, BambuLab's AMS setup, or "
"custom designs such as one by Prusa Research. Do your own research and "
"find out which of these is best for you if you deal with extremely "
"sensitive filaments."
