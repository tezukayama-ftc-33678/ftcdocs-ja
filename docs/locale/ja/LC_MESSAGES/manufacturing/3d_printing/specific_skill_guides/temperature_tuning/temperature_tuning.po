"In order to have strong, good quality 3d printed parts, you need to get "
"your temperatures and speeds right. Every filament that you buy will have"
" a range of temperatures that it thinks are acceptable to print it at, "
"but the one that works best for you depends on all sorts of conditions. "
"Start in the middle of that range, and work from there."

"This is the key to tuning filaments. There's a certain sweet temperature "
"when printing that helps lay the perfect amount of plastic down to "
"complete your part. Underextrusion looks like it's not quite able to get "
"continuous plastic out (you need to raise your temperature), and "
"Overextrusion looks like it's simply trying to melt too much (drooping "
"around the sides, so you need to lower your temp)."

"Extra about PLA: PLA is a really easy filament to work with, unless "
"you're trying to print it fast, in which case it becomes the worst "
"filament you've ever encountered. PLA is a filament that requires a lot "
"of cooling, otherwise it becomes really messy really quickly. Temperature"
" issues can appear in PLA due to either lack of cooling or improper "
"temperatures, so consider both of these factors when tuning for PLA. "
"Consider dropping your printing speed to isolate issues to just "
"temperature."
