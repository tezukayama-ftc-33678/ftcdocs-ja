"Layer height is the biggest factor affecting quality, speed, and "
"(somewhat) strength, if you are concerned about tolerances and quality, a"
" good starting point is 50% of your nozzle width (typically 0.4mm, so a "
"0.2mm width at 50%). On the other hand if you want more speed, at the "
"cost of some strength, opt for up to 75% of your nozzle width instead (up"
" to 0.32mm for a 0.4mm nozzle)."

"Walls refer to how many solid \"outer\" layers a print has a we'd "
"recommend anywhere from 3-5 walls for strong prints. Additionally, its a "
"good idea for all prints is to turn on an alternating extra shell. This "
"interlocks the walls with the infill more, making the infill stronger."

"3D Printers are amazing, but all machines unfortunately, have "

"plastic in midair and expect it to stay there. This is where supports "
"come in. Supports are excess printed material designed to be broken away "
"after the print. Generally, we want to avoid support material by "
"designing around it. But if not possible, it's a good idea to use "
"\"Support Enforcers\"/\"Paint On Supports\" to closely control what areas"
" you know need support. This makes cleanup after a print a lot easier."
