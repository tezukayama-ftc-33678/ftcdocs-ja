"Developed at the `University of Michigan "

" to a 2D barcode or a simplified QR Code. It contains a numeric **ID "

"One of the challenges teams will face this season is ensuring that their "
"cameras are able to see the AprilTags correctly. AprilTags rely on the "
"fact that the white and black portions of the AprilTags are contrasting "
"colors - if the lighting in the environment doesn't allow for enough "
"contrast, the AprilTag algorithm may not properly detect the AprilTag. "
"Fortunately, there are things we can do with virtually every webcam that "
"can help correct for environmental issues."

"An excellent example situation came up in a warehouse. The DECODE field "
"was set up in the warehouse, and using default settings with the "
"``ConceptAprilTagEasy`` sample.  When viewing the camera stream preview, "
"the AprilTag on the OBELISK was completely washed out by sunlight "
"striking the OBELISK directly on a sunny day, making the AprilTag unable "
"to be seen. A different camera at a slightly different angle took another"
" picture of the same scene, and the AprilTag can be seen but there is "
"definitely too much direct light reflecting off the AprilTag, making it "
"unable to be recognized. This scenario is very similar to a gymnasium "
"where an event could be hosted, and on a sunny day light can interfere "
"with a camera's ability to view an AprilTag. What can be done?"

"The best way to counter this environmental lighting is to use the webcam "
"settings within the SDK to adjust both the Gain and the Exposure settings"
" at the same time. By simultaneously minimizing the exposure (lessening "
"the amount of time light is allowed to strike the sensor each image "
"frame) and maximizing the gain (amplifying the signal from the sensor) "
"the resulting image will be darker than a normal image but elements of "
"high contrast will be accentuated, like AprilTags, allowing them to be "
"recognized. This can be experimented with using the "
"``ConceptAprilTagOptimizeExposure`` sample."

"Sure enough, by minimizing the Exposure and maximizing the Gain of the "
"webcam, the resulting images from the webcam were able to be used to "
"recognize the problematic AprilTags. For more examples, the "
"``RobotAutoDriveToAprilTag...`` sample OpModes also use this technique "
"for adjusting the exposure and gain settings of the camera to ensure the "
"AprilTags are readable under most conditions."

"One big advantage is that this technique (minimizing exposure while "

"Here are examples of the images once the exposure and gain are set "

"The OBELISK is an equilateral triangular prism (we know, real obelisks "

"centered on the GOAL-side of the FIELD, just outside of the FIELD "

"It might seem logical to read both AprilTags and use those two tags to "
