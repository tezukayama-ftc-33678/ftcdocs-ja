msgid "A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch, allowing you to work freely without disrupting the \"live\" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes."

msgid "A feature branch is a branch that is created to work on a new feature or bug. When you create a feature branch, you are making a copy of the main branch and working on the feature in isolation. Once the feature is complete, you can merge the feature branch back into the main branch."

msgid "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea."

The files in this repository are the official documentation for the FIRST Tech Challenge and the ones that are built and deployed to the `FTC Docs website <https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/>`_. This should not be confused with the main branch of a repository, which is the default branch of a repository."
