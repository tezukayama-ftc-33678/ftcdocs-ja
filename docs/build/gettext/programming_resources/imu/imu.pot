The new IMU chip is designated `BHI260AP <https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/smart-sensor-systems/bhi260ap/>`__, replacing the existing Hub’s IMU chip `BNO055 <https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/smart-sensors/bno055/>`__.  Both are from Bosch Sensortec. An IMU can measure many aspects of device motion; this explanatory document focuses primarily on **rotation**."
