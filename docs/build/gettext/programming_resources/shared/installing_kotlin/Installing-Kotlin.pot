msgid "The Kotlin programming language is a modern alternative to the Java programming language that compiles and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used to develop Android applications. It was developed by JetBrains, the same company that developed the IntelliJ IDE (the basis for Android Studio)."

msgid "Full interoperability with Java; you can use Java classes and libraries from Kotlin and vice versa."

msgid "Type inference; Kotlin allows you to use type inference when needed, that is, you don't need to specify the type of a variable when it can be inferred from the context (``var myString = \"Hi!\"``)."
