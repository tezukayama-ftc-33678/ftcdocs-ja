For more information on these ports please see the `REV Documentation <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/control-system-overview/control-hub-basics#input-power-specifications>`_. One of these ports may also be used to connect a grounding strap.

msgid "As the XT30 connector is known for its fragility it is highly recommended you be careful when using it. It is also recommended that you expand your connector prongs periodically. REV has a `troubleshooting article <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-the-control-system/control-hub-troubleshooting#xt30-pins-are-compressed>`_ specific to expanding the pins on the XT30 connector. For more information on this process please watch this `YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYXTiSeVmB0>`_. While this video features an XT60 connector, a larger version of the XT30, and a drone, the advice is much the same."

In that case it is possible for you to use an :ref:`additional hub<hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/configuring_dual_hubs/configuring-dual-hubs:using two expansion hubs>` or to use a `REV SPARKmini Motor Controller <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1230/>`_ (REV-31-1230) to power more motors.

However, it is also possible to use this port to connect to a standalone incremental encoder. To connect to more than 4 encoders it is currently necessary to connect an additional hub. For more information on this port please see `REV Encoder Port Documentation <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/control-system-overview/control-hub-basics#encoder-port-specifications>`_."

Be mindful of matching the polarity of the device attached to this port as it is possible to flip the connector.

There are 2 of these ports on each hub. These ports have 4 channels labeled from 0-4. This port can be used to connect to a standalone analog sensor. A common example of an analog sensor is a `potentiometer <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1155/>`_. An analog sensor is one that outputs a range of values rather than digital which alternates between one of two states. For more information on this port please see `REV Analog Port Documentation <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/control-system-overview/control-hub-basics#analog-port-specifications>`_."

There are 4 of these ports on each hub with a total of 8 channels labeled from `0-7`. A device attached to a digital port alternates between one of two states (e.g., on and off). One such device would be a button. It is important to note that each port has two channels and devices such as the `REV Touch Sensor <https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1425/>`_ will only operate on one channel (N+1)."

Each port is a single I2C bus where multiple sensors can be attached. Using sensors with identical addresses on the same bus can cause problems. While it is possible to use a large range of sensors, the vast majority of I2C sensors do not have drivers built into the SDK. It is possible to use community drivers or create your own.
