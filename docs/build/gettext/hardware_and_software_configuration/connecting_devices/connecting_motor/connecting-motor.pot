msgid "The Hub can drive up to four (4) 12V DC motors per Hub. The Hub uses a type of electrical connector known as a 2-pin JST VH connector. Many of the *FIRST* approved 12V DC motors are equipped with Anderson Powerpole connectors. An adapter cable can be used to connect the Anderson Powerpole connectors to the Hub motor port (see `FIRST Tech Challenge Robot Wiring Guide (PDF) <https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/team/robot-wires>`__ for more information)."

msgid "For the examples in this tutorial, *FIRST* recommends that the user build a simple rig to secure the motor in place and prevent it from moving about during the test runs. The image above shows a Tetrix motor installed in a rig built with a Tetrix motor mount and some Tetrix C-channels. A gear was mounted on the motor shaft to make it easier for the user to see the rotation of the shaft."
