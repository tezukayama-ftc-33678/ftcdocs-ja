msgstr ""

#: ../../source/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.rst:32
msgid "An electrostatic discharge (ESD) event occurs when a highly charged conductive object (like the metal frame of a robot) touches an uncharged or oppositely charged conductive object and discharges to it. Because of the high voltages involved (up to tens of kilovolts), ESD events can produce extremely high electrical currents as the charge that was accumulated on one object flows through a conductive path to the neutral or oppositely charged object."

msgid "Consider what happens when you shuffle your feet on a carpet in wool socks and then touch a door knob. You’ll almost certainly get a shock. What causes this phenomenon? When two surfaces interact, there is a small amount of adhesion. This means that they share electrons and if they are made from different materials the electron sharing may be uneven. When the surfaces are taken apart, they can become charged. This is called the triboelectric effect."

msgid "A robot’s wheels moving on field tiles build charge on the robot frame just like your wool socks moving on carpet build charge on your body.  Many other plastic and rubber materials behave similarly. It is important to note that triboelectric charging takes charge from one object and gives it to another, so the charges are mirrored. In the case of a *FIRST* Tech Challenge robot, positive charge accumulates on the wheels and negative charge accumulates on the tiles."

msgid "Current “wants” to flow from objects at higher potential to the objects at lower potential to equalize the voltage difference between them and it will if given a conductive path to do so (like an uninsulated wire). In the case of a robotics competition, if a robot is at a higher potential than another metallic object (such as a portion of the game field), an ESD event will occur if the frame of the charged robot contacts the other object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.rst:86
msgid "If the potential difference is high enough, it is also possible for current to flow through the air in the form of an electrical arc. Arcing occurs when the air between two differently charged conductors becomes ionized and allows current to flow from one conductor to the other. Arcs at voltages seen on *FIRST* Tech Challenge robots can jump air gaps of more than 3/8” (1 cm). Arcs behave almost like direct contact, so they can carry a significant amount of current. Visible sparks go with large electrostatic arcs."
