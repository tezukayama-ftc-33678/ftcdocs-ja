Notable ones include the Elegoo Neptune, Anycubic Vyper, and Voxelab Aquila. It's notable that while these are more or less \"Ender 3 Clones\", all three companies and printer models listed here are still established companies with community trust and acceptable customer service. These printers can be a great buy and are often cheaper but make sure to do research before purchasing."
